This project uses n8n to automate Sora2 videos. This project is currently in phase 1, where you are able to view the process that Sora2 API uses to create videos and how it can be automated within a workflow. Phase 2 of the project will be committed later, where involves the videos getting automatically added to a sheets doc and then automatically posted onto a social media account.
